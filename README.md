### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a backend developer and designer
- I'm a train enthusiast - probably will code something related to trains in the future
- I'm a big Katsuhiro Otomo fan
- I learned to code by myself, and I never attended university. 
- My biggest achievement is having a Discord bot serving more than 30k members.  It's very likely the first ever to reach that milestone using Realms as database.  

Programming languages: 
- My main language is Kotlin. 
- Python
- Rust
- Elixir/Erlang

**Zigoto**, my biggest project yet, will be unveiled soon.
